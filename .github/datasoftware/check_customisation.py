"""Verify that the DataSoftware customisation is intact.

This is the machine-checkable form of the "what to re-check after an upstream
merge" list in DATASOFTWARE_BUILD.md. It is cheap, needs no toolchain, and runs
both in the Windows build workflow (before the ~45 minute build) and in the
upstream sync workflow (to decide whether a merge is safe to propose).

Each check states what breaks if it fails, so a future maintainer does not have
to reverse-engineer the intent.

#     and the build it calls publishes with `prerelease: true` to that same
#     tag. Since the updater resolves versions through /releases/latest, which
#     skips pre-releases, letting it run silently stops every deployed client
#     from updating. fdroid.yml fires on the same tags, and flutter-nightly.yml
#     runs on a schedule; both only fail here.
#
#     ci.yml, flutter-ci.yml and wf-cliprdr-ci.yml are fine: they only push-
#     trigger on `master`, which this fork does not build from.
