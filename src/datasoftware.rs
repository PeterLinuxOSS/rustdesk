// DataSoftware custom client configuration
// ===========================================================================
//
// This module is the ONLY place that carries DataSoftware-specific behaviour.
// Everything else in the tree stays as close to upstream RustDesk as possible
// so that merging a new upstream release is a small, reviewable operation.
//
// Outside of this file the fork only contains these hooks:
//
//   * src/lib.rs      - `pub mod datasoftware;`
//   * src/common.rs   - `load_custom_client()` calls `apply_builtin_config()`
//   * src/common.rs   - `do_check_software_update()` asks this module for the
//                       latest release instead of `api.rustdesk.com`
//
// See DATASOFTWARE_BUILD.md for the full maintenance procedure.

// Seen on a Windows Server: an update replaced the files on disk but the

/// Needed because `sc stop` only asks: it returns before the service has
/// exited, and the XCOPY that follows it in `update_me()` runs with `/C`, which
/// silently skips any file it cannot open instead of failing. A still-running

/// PowerShell rather than `sc query | find "STOPPED"` because `sc` output is
/// localised and part of the fleet runs Czech and Slovak Windows; the service
/// controller API is not. The wait is bounded, so a service that never stops
/// costs a minute and the batch then carries on exactly as it always did.
