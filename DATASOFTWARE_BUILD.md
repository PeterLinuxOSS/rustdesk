# DataSoftware Remote — build and maintenance

`DataSoftware Remote` is a customised build of the RustDesk OSS client for
DataSoftware's self-hosted RustDesk infrastructure. It is a normal RustDesk
client: no RustDesk Server Pro features are used and no paid components are
required.

This document is the maintenance contract for the fork. It contains no secrets.

- Branch: `datasoftware-custom-client`
- Base: upstream tag `1.4.9`
- Upstream: <https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk>
- Fork: <https://github.com/PeterLinuxOSS/rustdesk>

## 1. What is customised

The customisation is deliberately tiny and kept in one place. Everything else
in the tree is untouched upstream code.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/datasoftware.rs` | **All** DataSoftware configuration and the update-source lookup. New file. |
| `src/lib.rs` | One line: `pub mod datasoftware;` |
| `src/common.rs` | Two marked hooks (see below). |
| `flutter/lib/desktop/pages/desktop_setting_page.dart` | About dialog: website link and copyright line. |
| `flutter/windows/runner/Runner.rc` | Windows executable metadata. |
| `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` | Build version (see §5). |
| `.github/workflows/datasoftware-windows.yml` | Windows x86_64 build and release. New file. |
| `.github/workflows/datasoftware-upstream-sync.yml` | Weekly upstream merge proposal. New file. |
| `.github/datasoftware/set_version.py` | Keeps the build version and the release tag in sync. New file. |
| `.github/datasoftware/check_customisation.py` | Verifies the customisation is intact. New file. |
| `.github/datasoftware/merge_upstream.sh` | Performs an upstream merge safely. New file. |
| `.claude/agents/upstream-sync.md` | Claude Code agent for merges that need judgement. New file. |
| `.github/datasoftware/generate_icons.py` + `logo-source.png` | Regenerates every icon from the logo. New files. |
| `flutter/lib/datasoftware.dart` | First-run permanent password. New file. |
| `flutter/lib/desktop/pages/desktop_home_page.dart` | One hook: shows the first-run password. |
| `flutter/assets/icon.png`, `res/*.png`, `res/*.ico`, `app_icon.ico` | Branded icons. |
| `src/lang/sk.rs`, `src/lang/en.rs` | Strings for the password dialog. |
| `.gitignore` | Two `!` exceptions so the new PNGs are not ignored. |

The hooks in `src/common.rs` are wrapped in
`// >>> DataSoftware ... <<<` comment markers so they are easy to find in a
merge conflict.

### Branding

- Application name: **DataSoftware-Remote**
- Company / website: **DataSoftware**, <https://datasoftware.sk>

> **The app name must not contain a space.** It is not just a label: upstream
> interpolates it unquoted into Windows shell commands — `sc create {app_name}`,
> `sc stop/delete/start {app_name}` and `taskkill /F /IM {app_name}.exe`, 17
> places in `src/platform/windows.rs` — and `res/msi/preprocess.py` runs
> `<dist>/<app name>.exe` through cmd.exe without quoting the path. A space
> splits the service name and breaks installation and the MSI build. Upstream
> documents the same constraint in `src/lang.rs`: *"app_name only contains
> alphanumeric and hyphen"*. `src/datasoftware.rs` has a unit test enforcing it,
> and the build workflow checks that its `APP_NAME` matches the Rust constant.
>
> The spaced form **DataSoftware Remote** is therefore used only where it is
> purely cosmetic and safe: the Windows executable metadata
> (`ProductName`, `FileDescription`) in `flutter/windows/runner/Runner.rc`, which
> is what Explorer shows under Properties → Details.

The name is set once, via `config::APP_NAME`. Upstream derives a lot from that
single value, so most of the branding follows automatically:

- window title (`flutter/windows/runner/main.cpp` reads it from the DLL through
  `get_rustdesk_app_name`),
- install directory `C:\Program Files\DataSoftware-Remote`, installed
  executable `DataSoftware-Remote.exe`, Windows service name and the
  Add/Remove Programs entry (`src/platform/windows.rs`),
- configuration directory `%APPDATA%\DataSoftware-Remote`,
- every translated string: `src/lang.rs` replaces `RustDesk` with the app name
  for custom clients, so e.g. `About RustDesk` renders as
  `About DataSoftware-Remote`,
- `is_custom_client()`, which upstream defines as
  `get_app_name() != "RustDesk"`.

MSI branding is passed to `res/msi/preprocess.py` as build arguments
(`--app-name`, `-m`), not patched into the source.

**Deliberately left as `rustdesk`** — changing these would break the build, the
updater or Windows compatibility:

- the Cargo package name, the `rustdesk.exe` build output and the
  `rustdesk-*` release asset names (see §4),
- `InternalName` / `OriginalFilename` in `Runner.rc`, which describe the actual
  built file,
- DLL, printer-driver, virtual-display and service component names,
  `RuntimeBroker_rustdesk.exe`, the `rustdesk://` URI scheme and the IPC
  protocol identifiers.

### Server configuration

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ID / rendezvous server | `api.datasoftware.sk` |
| API server | `https://remote.datasoftware.sk` |
| Relay server | empty — automatic |
| Public key | `7yMWvosWrAbR2iUFsvbyL0YrMx9P839UfShu+bdwMGg=` |
| `allow-auto-update` | `Y` |

Only the **public** server key is shipped. The RustDesk server private key must
never be committed to this repository.

### Icons

Every icon comes from the DataSoftware logo, regenerated from one source by:

```bash
python3 .github/datasoftware/generate_icons.py
```

The source is `.github/datasoftware/logo-source.png` (512x512, the app icon
from datasoftware.sk). Replace it and re-run to change the logo. RustDesk reads
icons from four unrelated places, and all four have to be updated together:

| File | Where it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `flutter/assets/icon.png` | In-app logo (`loadIcon()`) **and** the Windows tray: `src/tray.rs::load_icon_from_asset()` reads `data\flutter_assets\assets\icon.png` next to the exe and only falls back to `res/tray-icon.ico` if it is missing |
| `flutter/windows/runner/resources/app_icon.ico` | The executable, via `Runner.rc` |
| `res/icon.ico` | Copied into the MSI by `res/msi/preprocess.py`: installer and Add/Remove Programs |
| `res/tray-icon.ico` | Tray fallback, compiled in by `src/tray.rs` |

`.gitignore` has a repository-wide `*png` rule. `flutter/assets/icon.png` and
the logo source are new files in this fork, so they needed explicit `!`
exceptions — without them the branded tray icon silently never ships. The
`res/*.png` files were already tracked, so the rule never affected them.

### Client behaviour

| Setting | Value | Map |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `disable-discovery-panel` | `Y` | `OVERWRITE_LOCAL_SETTINGS` |

Enforced, so the "Discovered" (LAN discovery) tab is gone and the customer
cannot switch it back on.

**`verification-method` is deliberately left alone.** Upstream's default is
`use-both-passwords`, under which the permanent password already works
(`hbb_common::password_security::permanent_enabled()` is true for anything but
`OnlyUseTemporaryPassword`). Pinning `use-permanent-password` would not enable
anything — it would only switch off the one-time password, and that is the
only credential a machine has until the UI runs for the first time. Upstream
never generates a permanent password on its own, so on a silent MSI install
where nobody opens the window, pinning it would leave `has_valid_password()`
false and the machine unreachable. A unit test and a customisation check both
assert the override stays absent.

---

## 1b. First-run permanent password

RustDesk stores the permanent password **hashed** — that is why the main window
shows `-` once one is set. The plaintext exists only at the moment it is
chosen, and upstream never creates one by itself.

`flutter/lib/datasoftware.dart` therefore, on the first start of an *installed*
client, generates a 14-character password with `Random.secure()`, applies it
with `mainSetPermanentPasswordWithResult`, and shows it once in a dialog with a
copy button. Its only hook into upstream code is one call in
`desktop_home_page.dart`'s `initState`.

Properties worth knowing:

- **Per machine.** One compromised endpoint exposes nothing else. A single
  shared password baked into the build would have to sit in the binary in
  readable form for the dialog to display it, and anyone with the installer
  could extract it.
- **Never stored in plaintext** and never leaves the machine.
- **Dismissing without confirming is safe.** The next start generates and shows
  a *new* password rather than pretending to recover the old one, which is
  impossible. So the dialog always shows the password actually in effect.
- The acknowledgement is recorded in the local option
  `datasoftware-initial-password-acknowledged`.

  It lives in the **`[options]` table** of `<app name>_local.toml`, which is
  where `LocalConfig::get_option` reads it from. Setting it by appending to
  the end of that file puts it in whatever table happens to be last
  (`[ui_flutter]`), where it is silently ignored — and the dialog then
  generates a fresh password over whatever was there. That matters when
  adopting an existing identity, see §4c.
- The alphabet omits `0/O` and `1/l/I`, because this gets read off a screen and
  typed somewhere else.

### Locking the password

`disable-change-permanent-password` **is** set, but only after a password has
been provisioned. It cannot be unconditional: the flag makes
`Config::set_permanent_password()` return false, so switching it on from the
start would block this generator too and leave the machine with no permanent
password and no way to set one.

`apply_builtin_config()` therefore turns it on only when the acknowledgement
local option is `Y`. Before the first confirmation the lock is off so the
password can be generated; afterwards it is on. That ordering is also what
keeps "dismiss the dialog and get a fresh password next start" working.

It is a *local* option, so it is evaluated per process, which is deliberate:

- **The UI** reads its own `LocalConfig`, so `Settings → Security` hides the
  password control — it already honours this flag upstream — and
  `set_permanent_password_with_result()` refuses before the IPC to the service
  is even attempted. That is the only route the customer has.
- **The service** does not get the flag, which leaves
  `rustdesk.exe --password <new>` working as an administrative reset. Nothing
  in the service changes the password on its own.

The key literal is duplicated in `src/datasoftware.rs` (`INITIAL_PASSWORD_ACK`)
and `flutter/lib/datasoftware.dart` (`kDataSoftwareInitialPasswordAck`). A
drift would silently disable the lock, so `check_customisation.py` compares
them.

Dialog strings are translated; Slovak lives in `src/lang/sk.rs`, English in
`src/lang/en.rs`.

---

## 2. How the server configuration is implemented

`src/datasoftware.rs::apply_builtin_config()` is called from
`src/common.rs::load_custom_client()`.

Why there: `load_custom_client()` is the single function every process entry
point calls — `core_main()`, the Windows service (`src/service.rs`), the Flutter
FFI entry (`src/flutter_ffi.rs`) and the Windows installer path
(`src/platform/windows.rs`). Hooking the function instead of its call sites
means no process can start without the configuration. The Windows auto-updater
runs in the **service** process, so patching only `core_main()` would silently
break updates.

What it does:

- sets `config::APP_NAME`,
- puts the ID server, API server, public key and the (empty) relay into
  `config::OVERWRITE_SETTINGS`,
- puts `allow-auto-update = Y` into `config::DEFAULT_SETTINGS`.

These are exactly the maps upstream fills from a signed custom client bundle,
so the resulting behaviour is upstream behaviour.

`OVERWRITE_SETTINGS` values are enforced: `Config::get_option()` prefers them
over the user's configuration file, and `Config::set_option()` refuses to
persist a different value. `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` values are only defaults, so an
administrator can still turn auto-update off on a single machine.

Nothing is written to the user's configuration file, so a fresh install is
configured out of the box and unrelated user preferences are never overwritten
on startup.

### Why not upstream's `custom.txt`

Upstream's native custom-client mechanism (`read_custom_client()`) expects a
base64 blob that is **signed with a RustDesk-owned private key** and verified
against the public key hard-coded in `src/common.rs`. We cannot produce a valid
one, so we write the same values into the same maps directly.

The signed path is still intact: if a signed `custom.txt` is ever placed next
to the executable, `load_custom_client()` reads it after our defaults and it
wins.

The filename-based mechanism (`src/custom_server.rs`, the
`rustdesk-host=...,key=...` executable name, and the reversed-base64 config
string) also still works and takes priority via `EXE_RENDEZVOUS_SERVER`. It is
not used for this build.

---

## 3. How the updater was redirected

### Upstream flow

1. `src/rendezvous_mediator.rs` starts `updater::start_auto_update()` on
   Windows when the client is installed and running as the server/service.
2. `src/updater.rs::check_update()` honours `allow-auto-update` and calls
   `common::do_check_software_update()`.
3. `do_check_software_update()` POSTs to `https://api.rustdesk.com/version/latest`
   (via `hbb_common::version_check_request`), which answers with a
   `https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/releases/tag/<version>` URL, and stores
   it in `common::SOFTWARE_UPDATE_URL`.
4. `updater.rs` turns that into a download URL with
   `update_url.replace("tag", "download")` and appends
   `/rustdesk-<version>-<arch>.<exe|msi>`.
5. It downloads the asset and runs it with `--update`.

### What we changed

**Only step 3.** `do_check_software_update()` now calls
`datasoftware::fetch_latest_release_url()`, which does a plain
`GET https://api.github.com/repos/PeterLinuxOSS/rustdesk/releases/latest`
and returns
`https://github.com/PeterLinuxOSS/rustdesk/releases/tag/<tag_name>`.

Steps 1, 2, 4 and 5 are untouched upstream code, which is why the release asset
names must keep the upstream `rustdesk-*` pattern.

There is **no fallback** to `rustdesk/rustdesk` or to `api.rustdesk.com`: if the
GitHub lookup fails, the check simply fails and is retried later.

Side effects, both intentional:

- `hbb_common::version_check_request()` now has no callers in this tree, so the
  client no longer reports a device fingerprint to `api.rustdesk.com`.
- `libs/hbb_common` is an unmodified upstream submodule. The redirect lives
  entirely in the main repository, so the submodule never needs forking.

### Other `rustdesk/rustdesk` references

A repository-wide search still finds `rustdesk/rustdesk`, but none of the
remaining hits are part of the update mechanism:

- source comments linking to upstream issues, discussions and commits,
- `.github/workflows/fdroid.yml` (Android F-Droid metadata, not built here),
- `flutter/lib/desktop/pages/desktop_home_page.dart::buildHelpCards()`, which
  links to `rustdesk.com/download` and to an upstream changelog. That whole
  branch is guarded by `!bind.isCustomClient()` and therefore never renders in
  this client.

Re-run the check after any upstream merge:

```bash
grep -rn "rustdesk/rustdesk\|api.rustdesk.com" src/ | grep -v "^src/[a-z_/]*\.rs:[0-9]*: *//"
```

---

## 4. Release assets

`src/updater.rs` builds the download file name itself:

```
rustdesk-<tag>-<arch>.exe      # arch is x86_64 or aarch64
rustdesk-<tag>-<arch>.msi
```

So the asset names **must** keep the `rustdesk-` prefix even though the
installed application is called DataSoftware-Remote. The build workflow
produces exactly these names; nothing was renamed, and the updater and the
workflow agree by construction.

Two things follow from upstream's code:

- `update_msi = is_msi_installed() && !is_custom_client()`, and this is a custom
  client, so **the auto-updater always downloads the `.exe`**, even on machines
  installed from the MSI. The MSI is there for GPO/manual deployment.
- The release must be a **full release, not a pre-release**: the updater uses
  GitHub's `/releases/latest`, which skips drafts and pre-releases. The
  workflow already publishes with `prerelease: false`.

---

## 4b. Installing and updating — which method to use

Windows keeps one uninstall key per product, and `install_me()` and
`update_me()` in `src/platform/windows.rs` write it differently. That single
difference is the whole story behind the "The application is installed by
self-installation method, please uninstall it first" / error 2866 failures.

| registry value | `install_me()` | `update_me()` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UninstallString` | rewrites it to `"<exe>" --uninstall` | leaves it alone |
| `WindowsInstaller` | sets it to `0` | leaves it alone |
| `DisplayVersion`, `Version`, `BuildDate`, `VersionMajor/Minor/Build`, `EstimatedSize` | writes | writes |
| `%APPDATA%\<app name>\config` | untouched | untouched |

`is_msi_installed()` is exactly `WindowsInstaller == 1`. So a self-install on a
machine that was installed from the MSI flips that flag to `0`, and the MSI
registration becomes self-contradictory: msiexec still knows the ProductCode,
but the named key now claims a self-install. Every later MSI operation on that
machine fails with 2866.

| what you do | result |
| --- | --- |
| MSI over an MSI install | fine — WiX major upgrade, see the `Upgrade` table |
| EXE **Install** button over an EXE self-install | fine |
| EXE **Install** button over an MSI install | **breaks it** — the next MSI fails with 2866 |
| MSI over an EXE self-install | MSI refuses: "please uninstall it first" |
| auto-update | fine on both |

The auto-updater never calls `install_me()`. `updater.rs::update_new_version()`
launches `<downloaded>.exe --update`, which reaches `platform::update_me()`:
stop the service, copy the files, `rename_exe_cmd`, start the service. It writes
only version metadata, and on a custom client installed from the MSI it also
mirrors that metadata into the MSI's ProductCode key — see `get_reg_msi_key()`,
which deliberately requires `is_custom_client()`. Upstream built that path for
exactly this case, which is why `update_msi` excludes custom clients. **Do not
"fix" that condition**: it would move us off the path upstream tests.

One trap worth knowing: `is_setup()` is `name.ends_with("install.exe")` and the
release asset is `rustdesk-<tag>-<arch>.exe`, so double-clicking it does *not*
install anything — it opens the portable client. The damage only happens if
somebody then presses Install on a machine that came from the MSI.

**Rule: update with the same installer type you installed with, or let the
auto-updater do it.**

### Recovering a device the server refuses to register

The client's key pair lives in `%APPDATA%\<app name>\config\<app name>.toml`.
Nothing in our install, update or uninstall path removes it - the MSI's
`RemoveFile` table only drops the Start Menu folder, and its custom actions only
*read* the config. But if it is lost anyway (Windows reinstalled, profile wiped,
config cleaned by hand) the device keeps its ID, which is derived from the
machine, and presents a **new** public key.

The client then logs `server refused to register this device: NOT_SUPPORT`
every ~16 s and never registers. It does not regenerate its key, so restarting
or reinstalling does not help.

**`NOT_SUPPORT` is overloaded.** `signal/handler.go` returns it for three
different checks and the client cannot tell them apart:

| server log line | meaning | fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Enrollment: queued unknown peer <id> for approval` | normal, managed mode | approve it in Device Enrollment Requests |
| `Rejected PK registration of deleted peer` | the device was deleted | hard delete, then approve |
| `PK mismatch for <id>` | stored key differs | hard delete, then approve |

Always read the server log before acting. The first case is by far the most
common - every freshly installed client starts there - and deleting such a
device instead of approving it only makes things worse.

**Changing the ID does not help.** The client-driven ID change renames the
database row and carries the stored public key with it, so a mismatch simply
follows the device to its new ID. It also needs a live source row, so it fails
outright once the device has been deleted.

**The console's delete is a soft delete, and that blocks re-enrolment.** A
soft-deleted peer is refused at `RegisterPk` on purpose - see the
`GHSA-3v82-3gf8-fxx8` comment in `signal/handler.go`: restoring the row would
let an attacker overwrite the stored key with their own. There is no "reset
key" endpoint either; `PATCH /api/peers/{id}` accepts only `note`, `user`,
`tags` and `display_name`.

So a stuck device needs a **hard** delete, which the console UI does not offer:

```bash
# on the BetterDesk host; KEY is the server's .api_key from its key directory
curl -X DELETE -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" "http://127.0.0.1:21114/api/peers/<id>?hard=true"
```

That removes the stored key, the device re-enrols within ~16 s and appears in
Device Enrollment Requests for approval.

---

## 4c. Migrating a machine from stock RustDesk

There is **no server-side push**. Stock RustDesk has its updater compiled in,
pointing at `api.rustdesk.com`; no `config_options`, strategy or telemetry
command from the console turns it into this client. The binary has to be
replaced on the machine, over the remote session already in place.

### The trap: both clients derive the same peer ID

The ID comes from the machine, so the freshly installed client computes the
same one the stock client already uses. The key pair does not come from the
machine — each client generates its own — so the second one to register is
refused with `PK mismatch` and stays unreachable for ever.

It does not look like a failure. `/api/sysinfo` is a separate HTTPS channel
that keeps working, so the console shows the new `version` and the device
appears migrated while the stock client is still the one answering.

### The fix: adopt the identity instead of creating a new one

Config values are encrypted with a key derived from the **machine** uid, not
from the application name — `hbb_common::password_security::symmetric_crypt()`
calls `get_uuid()`. So the stock client's stored blobs decrypt correctly in
this client on the same machine, and its identity can simply be copied across:

```
%APPDATA%\RustDesk\config\RustDesk.toml   ->   ...\DataSoftware-Remote.toml
```

That file holds `enc_id`, `key_pair`, `password`, `salt` and `key_confirmed` —
the whole identity. Do the same for the service profile under
`%WINDIR%\ServiceProfiles\LocalService`, with the service stopped.

The server then sees the same ID presenting the public key it already has:
no mismatch, no re-approval, and **no interruption** — verified on a live
machine, where the peer's `uptime` ran unbroken through both the adoption and
the removal of the stock client. The permanent password carries over too, so
nothing has to be handed out again.

**Set the acknowledgement flag in the same pass.** It belongs in the
`[options]` table of `<app>_local.toml`:

```toml
[options]
datasoftware-initial-password-acknowledged = 'Y'
```

Appending it to the end of the file puts it in whatever table happens to be
last (`[ui_flutter]`), where `LocalConfig::get_option` never looks — and the
first-run dialog then generates a fresh password straight over the adopted
one. See §1b.

### Running it

`tools/Migrate-ToDataSoftware.ps1` does all of the below in one pass, with a
transcript, a rollback, and a refusal to remove stock until registration is
confirmed. In an elevated PowerShell on the target:

```powershell
$s = "$env:WINDIR\Temp\mig.ps1"
iwr -UseBasicParsing https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeterLinuxOSS/rustdesk/datasoftware-custom-client/tools/Migrate-ToDataSoftware.ps1 -OutFile $s
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $s
```

Two details, both learned from RustDesk's own elevated terminal:

- **`C:\Windows\Temp`, not `$env:TEMP`.** That terminal runs as SYSTEM, whose
  profile frequently has no `AppData\Local\Temp`, so `$env:TEMP` names a
  directory that is not there and the download dies with
  `DirectoryNotFoundException`. The script itself resolves this the same way,
  see `Get-ScratchDir`.
- **`-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`,** because a downloaded script will otherwise be
  refused outright. Passing it on the command line affects only that one
  process; it changes nothing on the machine. If Group Policy pins the policy
  even that is ignored, and the script has to be run from a local copy the
  policy already trusts.

Across many machines, fetch the MSI once onto a share and pass `-MsiPath` so
each run does not pull 24 MB again.

**There is no way to push this from the server.** `sync.rs` consumes only
`sysinfo`, `modified_at` and `strategy.config_options` from the heartbeat
reply - a RustDesk client has no remote-execution channel at all, by design.
BetterDesk's `POST /api/peers/{id}/exec` does not help either: it dispatches
over the mesh or CDAP agent transports and answers *device not connected via
mesh or cdap* for an ordinary RustDesk peer. Someone has to be in a session on
the machine.

### Order of operations

1. install this client over the stock remote session (§4b: use the MSI)
2. stop the service, adopt the identity, set the flag, start the service
3. **check the server**, not the client: `key_confirmed` is worthless here
   because it was copied in. Look for `in_memory: true` on
   `/api/peers/{id}/status` and no `PK mismatch` in the signal log.
4. only then uninstall stock RustDesk

Step 3 is not ceremony. Uninstalling stock on a machine whose new client is
not registered removes the only way back in.

If a local guard is wanted for step 4, judge the client log by the timestamp
on each line and open it with `FileShare::ReadWrite` — the running service
holds it open, and filtering by the file's modified time matches refusals from
hours ago and blocks a machine that is perfectly healthy.

---

## 5. Versioning — important

`crate::VERSION` is generated from the `version` field of `Cargo.toml`
(`hbb_common::gen_version()` writes `src/version.rs`). The updater compares the
release tag against `crate::VERSION`.

**If the built client reports a lower version than its own release tag, it will
re-download and re-install the same release on every check, forever.**

Therefore the release tag and the `Cargo.toml` version must be identical. The
workflow enforces this: on a tag push it runs
`.github/datasoftware/set_version.py "$TAG"`, which updates `Cargo.toml` **and**
`Cargo.lock` (the build uses `cargo build --locked`).

Use tags of the form `1.4.9-1`, `1.4.9-2`, … Upstream's `get_version_number()`
reads a trailing `-N` as a numeric build suffix, so `1.4.9-1` compares as newer
than the `1.4.9` base. A non-numeric suffix such as `1.4.9-ds1` parses as plain
`1.4.9` and would never be offered as an update; `set_version.py` rejects it.

The tag must also not contain the substring `tag`, because upstream builds the
download URL with `update_url.replace("tag", "download")`.
`fetch_latest_release_url()` checks this at runtime.

## 6. How to build

### GitHub Actions (the supported way)

Workflow: `.github/workflows/datasoftware-windows.yml`, target Windows x86_64.

It reuses upstream's own reusable workflows for the prerequisites
(`.github/workflows/bridge.yml` and
`.github/workflows/third-party-RustDeskTempTopMostWindow.yml`) and mirrors the
Windows x86_64 steps of upstream's `.github/workflows/flutter-build.yml`.

Triggers:

- **manual** (`workflow_dispatch`) — optional `version`, and
  `publish-release` to also create the GitHub release,
- **tag push** matching `1.4.9` or `1.4.9-1` — builds and publishes the release.

Artifacts:

| Name | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `rustdesk-<version>-x86_64.exe` | portable / self-extracting installer |
| `rustdesk-<version>-x86_64.msi` | Windows installer |
| `datasoftware-remote-unsigned-windows-x86_64` | the unpacked build directory |

Code signing is not configured. Upstream's signing steps depend on
`secrets.SIGN_BASE_URL` / `secrets.SIGN_SECRET_KEY` and were left out.
Unsigned binaries will show a SmartScreen warning.

### Locally (Windows)

Requires Rust 1.75, Flutter 3.24.5, LLVM 15, vcpkg and Python 3. Follow
upstream's build instructions, then:

```bash
python3 .github/datasoftware/set_version.py 1.4.9-1
python3 build.py --portable --flutter --skip-portable-pack --hwcodec --vram

## 7. How to publish a release

1. Make sure `datasoftware-custom-client` is up to date and builds.
2. Pick the next build number, e.g. `1.4.9-2`.
3. Commit the version bump (optional — the workflow sets it anyway):
   ```bash
   python3 .github/datasoftware/set_version.py 1.4.9-2
   git commit -am "DataSoftware Remote 1.4.9-2"
   ```
4. Tag and push:
   ```bash
   git tag 1.4.9-2
   git push origin datasoftware-custom-client 1.4.9-2
   ```
5. The workflow builds and publishes the release with both assets.
6. Verify the release is **not** marked as a pre-release and that both
   `rustdesk-1.4.9-2-x86_64.exe` and `.msi` are attached.

Existing clients pick it up within a day (first check 30 s after start, then
every 24 h, skipped while a session is active).

## 8. How to merge a new upstream RustDesk release

This is mostly automated. Three pieces do the work:

| Piece | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `.github/datasoftware/check_customisation.py` | Verifies every invariant below that can be checked mechanically. Runs in seconds, needs no toolchain. |
| `.github/datasoftware/merge_upstream.sh` | Does the merge, auto-resolves the version conflict, runs the checks, and refuses to commit a merge that breaks them. |
| `.github/workflows/datasoftware-upstream-sync.yml` | Weekly: finds the newest upstream release, runs the merge, and either opens a PR or opens an issue describing the conflicts. Never pushes to the DataSoftware branch. |

There is also a Claude Code agent, `.claude/agents/upstream-sync.md`, for the
conflicts that need judgement.

### The automated path

The scheduled workflow opens a pull request when a merge is clean. Review it,
run the Windows build, test on Windows, then merge. You can also start it by
hand from the Actions tab, optionally naming a specific tag.

### By hand

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk.git   # once
git fetch upstream --tags
git checkout -b upstream-sync/1.5.0 datasoftware-custom-client
bash .github/datasoftware/merge_upstream.sh 1.5.0
```

The script auto-resolves the one conflict that happens on **every** upstream
release — `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`, because upstream bumps the version and
we carry a `-N` build suffix — by taking upstream's files and re-applying our
version as `<upstream version>-1`. Those are the only lines we change in them.
Any other conflict is aborted and reported, because guessing at a conflict in
`src/common.rs` is how the auto-updater ends up pointing back at
`rustdesk/rustdesk`.

### What the automation cannot do

`check_customisation.py` is pattern matching. It proves the hooks are *present*;
it cannot prove upstream did not change what the surrounding code *means*. So
after any merge, read the upstream diff for `src/common.rs`, `src/updater.rs`,
`src/platform/windows.rs` and `res/msi/preprocess.py`, and check, in this order:

1. **`src/common.rs::do_check_software_update()`** — the most fragile hook. If
   upstream changed how the latest version is discovered, or the shape of the
   URL it stores in `SOFTWARE_UPDATE_URL`, adapt the hook. The contract our code
   must satisfy is: return `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/tag/<version>`.
2. **`src/common.rs::load_custom_client()`** — confirm
   `apply_builtin_config()` is still called, and that it is still the single
   entry point used by every process.
3. **`src/updater.rs`** — confirm the asset name pattern is still
   `rustdesk-<version>-<arch>.<exe|msi>` and that
   `update_url.replace("tag", "download")` is still how the download URL is
   built. If the pattern changed, change the workflow to match.
4. **`keys::OPTION_*` constants** — `check_customisation.py` verifies these
   resolve from the crate `src/datasoftware.rs` imports them from, so a move is
   caught before the build. It has already happened: in 1.4.9 they live in
   `libs/hbb_common/src/config.rs`, but on `master` (1.5.0-dev) all of
   `OPTION_CUSTOM_RENDEZVOUS_SERVER`, `OPTION_API_SERVER`, `OPTION_KEY` and
   `OPTION_ALLOW_AUTO_UPDATE` moved to `libs/base/src/config/keys.rs`, leaving
   only "the keys hbb_common itself references" behind. **Merging 1.5.0 will
   therefore require changing the `use` in `src/datasoftware.rs` from
   `hbb_common::config::{self, keys, Config}` to import `keys` from `base`
   instead** — a one-line change. What the check cannot tell you is whether a
   key moved to a *different settings map*, which would silently change whether
   a value is enforced; verify that by hand against `KEYS_SETTINGS`.
5. **`config::APP_NAME` / `is_custom_client()`** — if upstream stops deriving
   custom-client behaviour from the app name, revisit the branding.
6. **`res/msi/preprocess.py`** — confirm `--app-name` and `-m` still exist and
   that the main executable is still expected as `<app name>.exe`.
7. **`flutter/windows/runner/Runner.rc`** and the About dialog strings —
   re-apply if upstream rewrote them.
8. **`.github/workflows/datasoftware-windows.yml`** — re-sync the `env:` block
   (`FLUTTER_VERSION`, `SCITER_RUST_VERSION`, `LLVM_VERSION`, `VCPKG_COMMIT_ID`)
   and the build steps with upstream's `flutter-build.yml`.

The workflow runs cheap guard rails before the long build: formatting of
`src/datasoftware.rs`, the presence of all three hooks, and a check that no
update path still points at `rustdesk/rustdesk` or `api.rustdesk.com`. It also
fails the build if the produced executable does not report the expected
branding and version.

## 9. Verifying a build on Windows

After installing the produced `.exe` or `.msi`:

1. The window title, Start menu entry and Add/Remove Programs say
   **DataSoftware-Remote**.
2. Right-click `DataSoftware-Remote.exe` → Properties → Details:
   Product name `DataSoftware Remote`, Company `DataSoftware` — the spaced
   form is intentional here; see the note in §1.
3. Settings → Network: ID server `api.datasoftware.sk`, API server
   `https://remote.datasoftware.sk`, relay empty, key ends with `+bdwMGg=`.
   These fields are enforced and cannot be changed.
4. The client gets an ID and a remote session works in both directions.
5. The window, taskbar, tray and Add/Remove Programs all show the DataSoftware
   logo, not the RustDesk one. The tray is the one most likely to be missed: it
   comes from `flutter_assets/assets/icon.png`, not from the `.ico`.
6. The peer list has no "Discovered" tab, and it cannot be re-enabled.
7. On the very first start a dialog shows a 14-character permanent password.
   Confirm it, restart, and check it does not appear again. Then connect from
   another machine using that password.
8. After confirming, `Settings → Security` no longer offers to change the
   password. `rustdesk.exe --password <new>` from an elevated prompt still
   works, which is the intended administrative reset.
9. `%APPDATA%\DataSoftware-Remote\config\RustDesk2.toml` contains no
   `custom-rendezvous-server` entry — the value comes from the built-in
   override, not from the user's file.
10. Auto-update: with a newer release published, the service picks it up within
    24 h. To test immediately, install an older build and watch
    `%APPDATA%\DataSoftware-Remote\log\` — the update check runs 30 s after the
    service starts.
11. Confirm in the log, or with a network capture, that the client contacts
    `api.github.com/repos/PeterLinuxOSS/rustdesk` and never
    `api.rustdesk.com/version/latest`.
