description: Merges a new upstream RustDesk release into the DataSoftware client without breaking the customisation. Use when upstream publishes a release, when the scheduled sync workflow opens a "needs a manual merge" issue, or when asked to bring the fork up to date with rustdesk/rustdesk.

You bring `PeterLinuxOSS/rustdesk` up to date with upstream `rustdesk/rustdesk`
without damaging the DataSoftware customisation.

`DATASOFTWARE_BUILD.md` is the specification. Read it before you touch anything.

## The customisation you must preserve

Everything DataSoftware-specific is in `src/datasoftware.rs`. The rest of the
tree carries exactly three hooks, each wrapped in `// >>> DataSoftware ... <<<`
markers:

| Where | What |
| --- | --- |
| `src/lib.rs` | `pub mod datasoftware;` |
| `src/common.rs`, in `load_custom_client()` | `crate::datasoftware::apply_builtin_config();` |
| `src/common.rs`, in `do_check_software_update()` | `crate::datasoftware::fetch_latest_release_url()` |

Plus branding in `flutter/windows/runner/Runner.rc` and the About dialog in
`flutter/lib/desktop/pages/desktop_setting_page.dart`, the build version in
`Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock`, and the two workflows under `.github/workflows/`
whose names start with `datasoftware-`.

Two properties matter more than anything else, because breaking either is
silent and ships to customers:

1. **No update path may reach `rustdesk/rustdesk` or `api.rustdesk.com`.** If a
   merge restores upstream's version lookup, customers get upstream's client
   installed over yours.
2. **The version in `Cargo.toml` must equal the release tag.** If the client
   reports a lower version than its own release, it reinstalls that release on
   every check, forever.

## Procedure

1. **Confirm the starting state is clean.**
   ```bash
   git status --short
   git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
   python3 .github/datasoftware/check_customisation.py
   ```
   If the checks already fail before you merge, stop and report that — you would
   otherwise be unable to tell your damage from pre-existing damage.

2. **Fetch upstream and pick the target.** Prefer a stable release tag
   (`X.Y.Z`) over `master`.
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk.git 2>/dev/null || true
   git fetch upstream --tags
   git tag -l --merged upstream/master | grep -E '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$' | sort -V | tail -5
   ```

3. **Work on a dedicated branch.** Never merge onto
   `datasoftware-custom-client` directly.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b upstream-sync/<tag> datasoftware-custom-client
   ```

4. **Try the scripted merge first.**
   ```bash
   bash .github/datasoftware/merge_upstream.sh <tag>
   ```
   It handles the `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock` version conflict that happens on
   every upstream release, updates the submodule, runs the customisation checks
   and commits. If it prints `status=merged`, go to step 6.

   If it prints `status=conflict`, it has already aborted the merge and told you
   which paths need judgement. Continue with step 5.

5. **Resolve real conflicts yourself.**
   ```bash
   git merge --no-commit --no-ff <tag>
   git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
   ```
   Per file:

   - **`src/common.rs`** — the dangerous one. Keep upstream's version of
     everything, then re-apply our two hooks. In
     `do_check_software_update()`, the body must start with our
     `fetch_latest_release_url()` call and nothing may call
     `hbb_common::version_check_request`. In `load_custom_client()`,
     `apply_builtin_config()` must be the first statement, before the
     `custom.txt` handling. If upstream restructured the update flow, read the
     new code and re-implement the hook so it still yields a
     `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/tag/<version>` URL — that is
     the shape `src/updater.rs` depends on.
   - **`src/datasoftware.rs`** — should never conflict; it is ours alone. If it
     does, someone edited it upstream-side; keep our version.
   - **`Cargo.toml` / `Cargo.lock`** — take upstream's file, then
     `python3 .github/datasoftware/set_version.py <upstream-version>-1`.
   - **`flutter/windows/runner/Runner.rc`** — keep upstream's structure, re-apply
     the four branded values, and leave `InternalName` and `OriginalFilename`
     as `rustdesk`/`rustdesk.exe`.
   - **Anything else** — prefer upstream. We do not intentionally modify any
     other file, so a conflict there means upstream changed something we only
     touched incidentally.

6. **Verify, and read the diff that the checks cannot see.**
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   python3 .github/datasoftware/check_customisation.py
   ```
   The checks are pattern matches. They prove the hooks are present; they cannot
   prove upstream did not change what the surrounding code *means*. So also read:
   ```bash
   git diff <old-base>..<tag> -- src/updater.rs src/common.rs src/platform/windows.rs res/msi/preprocess.py
   ```
   and answer explicitly, in your report:
   - Does `src/updater.rs` still build asset names as
     `rustdesk-<version>-<arch>.<exe|msi>`? If upstream changed the pattern,
     update `.github/workflows/datasoftware-windows.yml` to publish the new
     names, so the updater and the workflow still agree.
   - Does it still derive the download URL with `replace("tag", "download")`?
   - Is `load_custom_client()` still the single entry point every process uses?
     Check `core_main.rs`, `service.rs`, `flutter_ffi.rs` and
     `platform/windows.rs`. The auto-updater runs in the **service** process.
   - Did `res/msi/preprocess.py` change its `--app-name` / `-m` arguments or
     stop expecting `<dist>/<app name>.exe`?
   - Did the `env:` block of upstream's `flutter-build.yml` change
     (`FLUTTER_VERSION`, `SCITER_RUST_VERSION`, `LLVM_VERSION`,
     `VCPKG_COMMIT_ID`)? If so, mirror it into
     `.github/workflows/datasoftware-windows.yml`.

7. **Push the branch and open a pull request.** Never push to
   `datasoftware-custom-client`, never force-push, never delete branches, and
   never create a release tag — a tag publishes a public release to customers.

8. **Report** the upstream tag, the new version, every file you resolved by
   hand and why, the answers to the step 6 questions, and what still needs
   testing on a real Windows machine (`DATASOFTWARE_BUILD.md` section 9).

## Do not

- Do not "fix" a failing check by weakening `check_customisation.py`. The check
  is the contract; if upstream genuinely moved something, update the hook and
  say so in your report.
- Do not globally replace `rustdesk` with `DataSoftware`. Internal identifiers,
  DLL, driver and service component names, the `rustdesk://` URI scheme, the
  package name and the `rustdesk-*` release asset names must stay.
- Do not put a space in the app name. It is interpolated unquoted into
  `sc create` / `taskkill` commands in `src/platform/windows.rs`.
- Do not claim the build works unless you actually ran it and saw it pass.
